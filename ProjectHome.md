SphinxKeys lets you essentially type keyboard keys and mouse clicks by speaking into your microphone; since most computer programs offer extensive keyboard shortcuts, you can can use SphinxKeys to control your computer.  SphinxKeys also understands a few simple commands that help you with common computer tasks such as using the clipboard or entering passwords.  SphinxKeys emphasizes simplicity and "just working" rather than attempting sophisticated language parsing, or integration with other programs.  Just think of it as typing by speaking.

All the basic details needed to get started are in the [README](http://code.google.com/p/sphinxkeys/wiki/README) file.
